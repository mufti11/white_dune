<h2>"white_dune", what's that ?</h2> 
<p>
"white_dune" is a continuation of the "dune" project by Stephan F. White.<br>
"dune" is a graphical VRML97/X3D Editor, simple NURBS modeller and animation 
tool with some OpenGL scene rendering capabilities.
</p>
<h2><a name="overview">white_dune program overview</a></h2>
<p>
In princple, the structure of the white_dune program can be written as:
<ol>
 <li> 
  evaluate commandline parameters
 </li>
 <li>
  enter GUI (Grapical User Interface) mainloop
 </li>
</ol>
For details, see the file <b>main.cpp</b>
</p>
<h2><a name="gui_overview">white_dune GUI overview</a></h2>
<p>
The GUI of white_dune consists of 2 parts:
<ol>
 <li>
  2D GUI<br>
  This handles two dimensional operations like opening windows,
  display icons, menus, buttons etc.<br>
  2D GUI operations are seperated in a extra programming level,
  called swt (Stephan White Toolkit).<br>
  Currently, there are two different implementations of swt written in C,
  one for Motif/Lesstif (Unix/Linux) and one for Win32 (M$Windows).<br>
  For details, see the directory <b>swt</b>.
  swt use M$Windows rc files. For details about the implementation 
  on M$Windows machines see the directory <b>swt/rc</b>.<br>
 </li>
 <li>3D GUI<br>
  This handles three dimensional operations. This is displaying 3D data
  (rendering, implemented in OpenGL) and manipulating 3D Objects.<br>
  Some 3D operations, like mouseinput and reaction to desktop events
  (e.g. resize of Windows) are handled in connection with the 2D GUI
  (see the file <b>Scene3DView.cpp</b> for details).<br>
  Additional, there are other sources of information for manipulating 
  3D Objects (also handled in <b>Scene3DView.cpp</b>): input from
  devices like joystick, dialbox or spaceball. Code for input
  from this devices is located in the file <b>InputDevice.cpp</b>.
 </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
The 2D GUI mainloop of white_dune is event driven. Typical events are
mouse-movement, mouse-click, resize of window and so on.<br>
Additionally the mainloop can produce timer events.<br>
When a event occures, the matching callback function is started.
The callbacks work for every subwindow of white_dune.<br>
The following image shows the subwindows (red text) of the mainwindow.<br>
<center>
<img src=dune.png alt="subwindows of the mainwindow" align="top">
</center><br>
Some 2D GUI events are distributed to the different subwindows.
The distribution of this events is based on inheritance.<br>
The class <b>SceneView</b> define inheritable 2D GUI callbacks like 
<i>OnMouseMove</i> and is parent class to the classes 
<b>ChannelView</b>, <b>FieldView</b>, <b>Scene3DView</b>, 
<b>SceneGraphView</b>, <b>SceneTreeView</b>, <b>StatusBar</b>,
<b>ToolbarWindow</b> and <b>PanedWindow</b>. <b>PanedWindow</b> is 
parent class to the class <b>MainWindow</b>.
</p> 
<p>
A additional callback <i>OnUpdate</i> is used to distribute 
messages like <i>UPDATE_FIELD</i> or <i>UPDATE_ADD_NODE</i> to the 
child classes of <b>SceneView</b>. <i>OnUpdate</i> is started by
the function <i>UpdateViews</i> of class <b>Scene</b>.<br>
</p> 
<p>
Some operations require additional input of data. Then a "Dialog" 
is opened, that block the data input to all other windows.<br>
<center>
<img src=dialog.jpg alt="a example of a dialog" align="top">
</center><br>
*Dialog classes are all inheritable from the class <b>Dialog</b>,
which implements functions like SaveData() and Validate().<br>
The layout of Dialogs (as well as the layout of the menues) is defined 
in the dune*.rc files.
</p>
<h2><a name="vrml_implementation_overview">VRML/X3D implementation overview</a></h2>
<p>
The class <b>Scene</b> (Scene.h/cpp) can be identified with one VRML/X3D file. 
For example Scene.write() writes the VRML/X3D file to disk.
</p> 
<p>
The global variable <i>TheApp</i> of class <b>DuneApp</b> (DuneApp.h/cpp)
can be identified with things that are global to all VRML/X3D files.
</p>
<h4>Node overfield</h4>
<p>
The internals of each VRML/X3D Node are implemented in the files named
Node<b>NodeName</b> (for example Node<b>Transform</b> (NodeTransform.h/cpp), 
Node<b>Shape</b> (NodeShape.h/cpp) or Node<b>Box</b> (NodeBox.h/cpp)).
</p>
<p>
Every Node<b>NodeName</b>.h file contain 2 classes: the 
class Node<b>NodeName</b> which contain functionality 
like draw() for 3D rendering of shapes and the class
Proto<b>NodeName</b> which are used to build the definitions
of the VRML97 standard.<br>
For example, the definiton of the Transform Node in
the ISO/IEC 14772 standard <br>
<img src=standard.jpg alt="example from vrml standard" align="top"><br>
is implemented in the constructor of the class Proto<b>Transform</b>
(in file NodeTransform.cpp):<br>
<pre>
ProtoTransform::ProtoTransform(Scene *scene)
  : Proto(scene, "Transform")
{
    addEventIn(MFNODE, "addChildren");
    addEventIn(MFNODE, "removeChildren");
    center.set(addExposedField(SFVEC3F, "center", new SFVec3f(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f)));
    children.set (addExposedField(MFNODE, "children", new MFNode(), CHILD_NODE));
    rotation.set(addExposedField(SFROTATION, "rotation", new SFRotation(0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f)));
    scale.set(addExposedField(SFVEC3F, "scale", new SFVec3f(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f), new SFFloat(0.0f)));
    scaleOrientation.set(addExposedField(SFROTATION, "scaleOrientation",new SFRotation(0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f)));
    translation.set(addExposedField(SFVEC3F, "translation", new SFVec3f(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f)));
    bboxCenter.set(addField(SFVEC3F, "bboxCenter", new SFVec3f(0, 0, 0)));
    bboxSize.set(addField(SFVEC3F, "bboxSize", new SFVec3f(-1, -1, -1), new SFFloat(-1.0f)));
}
</pre>
Different fields are internally handled as integer values.<br>
The variables center, children, rotation, scale, scaleOrientation, translation,
bboxCenter and bboxSize are of type "fieldIndex", something like a readonly
integer, that can be only set once.<br>
There are NodeTransform memberfunctions to get and set field values.
For example, the memberfunctions for the field "center" of class 
"NodeTransform" are:<br><br>
<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0>
<tr><td nowrap align=right valign=top><a href="doxygen_out_html/html/classSFVec3f.html">SFVec3f</a> *&nbsp;</td><td valign=bottom><a  href="doxygen_out_html/html/classNodeTransform.html#a17">center</a> (void)</td></tr>
<tr><td nowrap align=right valign=top>void&nbsp;</td><td valign=bottom><a  href="doxygen_out_html/html/classNodeTransform.html#a18">center</a> (<a  href="doxygen_out_html/html/classSFVec3f.html">SFVec3f</a> *value)</td></tr>
<tr><td nowrap align=right valign=top>void&nbsp;</td><td valign=bottom><a  href="doxygen_out_html/html/classNodeTransform.html#a19">center</a> (<a  href="doxygen_out_html/html/classSFVec3f.html">SFVec3f</a> &amp;value)</td></tr>
<tr><td nowrap align=right valign=top>int&nbsp;</td><td valign=bottom><a  href="doxygen_out_html/html/classNodeTransform.html#a20">center_Field</a> (void)</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
The memberfunctions "something_Field()" deliver the integer number of a field 
that is needed for example for a 
<a href="doxygen_out_html/html/classMoveCommand.html#a0">
MoveCommand</a> to move nodes in the scenegraph.
</p>
<p>
Functionality common to all Nodes (like writing a Node to a file (Node.write())
is in the class Node (file Node.h/cpp). All Node<b>NodeName</b> classes are
subclasses of the class Node.<br>
Some of the memberfunctions of the class Node are virtual and can be
overwritten by the Node<b>NodeName</b> classes (for example, the
class NodeScript need a special version of Node.write()).<br>
Here is a list of important virtual Node memberfunctions:
<ul>
  <li><b><a href=doxygen_out_html/html/classNodeData.html#a17>getType()</a></b><br>
      deliver a <a href=doxygen_out_html/html/Node_8h.html#a83>
      value</a> needed to identify different nodes. For example,
      the transform node deliver VRML_TRANSFORM.<br>
      The result of getType() is either beginning
      <ul>
         <li>"VRML_" for nodes which exist in VRML97</li>
         <li> "X3D_" for nodes which exist in X3D</li>
         <li>"COVER_" for nodes which are extensions in the 
             cover VRML browser</li>
         <li>"KAMBI_" for nodes which are extensions in the 
             kambi VRML gameengine</li>
         <li>"DUNE_" for nodes which only exist in white_dune 
             (scripted PROTOs and export data container nodes)</li>
      </ul>
  <li><b><a href=doxygen_out_html/html/classNodeData.html#a2>write</a></b><br>
      write the node to a VRML/X3D file.
  <li><b><a href=doxygen_out_html/html/classNodeData.html#a30>update</a></b><br>
      update a node after a field change.
  <li><b><a href=doxygen_out_html/html/classNodeData.html#a63>setHandle</a></b><br>
      change a node field from handles (e.g. white boxes in the Scene3DView, 
      that can be moved around with the mouse).
  <li><b><a href=doxygen_out_html/html/classNodeData.html#a62>getHandle</a></b><br>
      get the value of a handle.
  <li><b><a href=doxygen_out_html/html/classNodeData.html#a61>drawHandles</a></b><br>
      draw the handle in the Scene3DView.
  <li><b><a href=doxygen_out_html/html/classNodeData.html#a55>preDraw</a></b><br>
      do operations that prepare the drawing of nodes in the Scene3DView.
  <li><b><a href=doxygen_out_html/html/classNodeData.html#a58>draw</a></b><br>
      drawing the nodes in the Scene3DView (and internally to find
      mouse hits).      
</ul>
Some geometry nodes (like ElevationGrid) are implemented as a subclass of
<b>MeshBasedNode</b>. The MeshBasedNode class is used for geometry that
can implemented as a IndexedFaceSet type of mesh. The MeshBasedNode class 
provides important virtual Node memberfunctions like <b>draw</b>.
The creation of the mesh in a MeshBasedNode is done via the virtual
function <b>createMesh</b>.<br>
Some geometry nodes (like NodeSuperShape) are implemented as a subclass
of <b>MeshMorphingNode</b> which is a subclass of MeshBasedNode by itself.
A MeshMorphingNode can write a morphing animation of a IndexedFaceSet,
when "File-&gt;Export As...-&gt;Export as &Pure VRML97..." or
"File-&gt;Export As...-&gt;Export as VRML level &X3DV..." is used.<br>
For templates of a MeshBased/MeshMorphing geometry node see 
<a href="NodeGeometryExample.cpp">NodeGeometryExample.cpp</a>/
<a href="NodeGeometryExample.h">NodeGeometryExample.h</a>.<br>
For templates for the rest of nodes see
<a href="NodeExample.cpp">NodeExample.cpp</a>/
<a href="NodeExample.h">NodeExample.h</a>.<br>
</p>
<h4>FieldValue overfield</h4>
<p>
The class "FieldValue" is used to set the data of the nodes.
The wellknown VRML/X3D types like SFFloat, MFVec3f, SFString etc. are 
subclasses of the "FieldValue" class.<br>
When setting data of the nodes, it is important that the old data is
always deallocated using the "delete" command.<br>
The constructor of "MF-type" data (like MFVec3f, MFInt32, MFString etc.)
never copy the data array, it reuses the data via a pointer.<br>
<a name="wrong_field_data">Therefore</a>
it is not possible to use "automatic" variables (like 
"float data[30]") to initalise MF-type data directly. When the 
automatic variable is removed from the memory, the data inside the
node is also lost and it is likely, that a crash would occure.<br>
Wrong example:<br>
<pre>
   {
       float data[20];
       ...
       MFFloat data4node = new MFFloat(data, 20);
       ...
       someNode->setField(fieldName_Field(), data4node);
       ...
   } // someNode.fieldName gets invalid cause memory is freed at this point
</pre>
A other example of automatic variable usage uses a internal white_dune 
data type like "array", "list" etc.:<br>
<pre>
   {
       Array<float> data;
       ...
       data.append(1.0f);
       ...
       data.append(42.0f);
       ...
       MFFloat data4node = new MFFloat(data.getData(), data.size());
       ...
       someNode->setField(fieldName_Field(), data4node);
       ...
   } // someNode.fieldName gets invalid cause memory is freed at this point
</pre>
The correct way uses "new"
<pre>
   {
       float* data = new float[20];
       ...
       MFFloat data4node = new MFFloat(data, 20);
       ...
       someNode->setField(fieldName_Field(), data4node);
       ...
   } // someNode.fieldName ok
</p>
<h4>Path overview</h4>
<p>
As Path is a class that holds the path to a node in the Scenegraph or
in a PROTO. The path in the Scenegraph is mainly a integer array of
the fields containing the SFNode or MFNode field of the next node
(one integer) and the index of the next MFNode field (or 0 in case of a
SNode field) (another integer).<br>
If path[0] is less than zero, the path is inside a PROTO. A path[0] == -1
is inside the first PROTO, a path[0] == -2 is inside the second proto,
a path[0] == -3 is inside the third PROTO etc. <br>
In case of a PROTO, path[1] contains the number of the root node of the PROTO:
path[1] == 0 is the path beginning with the first root node, path[1] == 1 is 
the path beginning with the second root node, path[1] == 2 is the path 
beginning with the third root node.
</p>
<h4>PROTO overview</h4>
<p>
Proto is the PROTO interface (ProtoDeclare or ExternProtoDeclare) or 
Node interface. Node::getProto() gets the node interface.
<br>
NodePROTO is a ProtoInstance or ExternProtoInstance.
ExternProtoDeclare is a ProtoDeclare with variable "url" set.
</p>
<h2><a name="vrml_parser">VRML97/X3D parser</a></h2>
<p>
Dune need to read and parse ("understand") VRML97 or X3DV files.<br>
This is done with using the tools lex/yacc (it looks like, the advanced 
tools flex and bison from the GNU project are needed). <br>
The file lexer.l do the lexical analysis (detect things like "what is
a string", "what is a number", "what is that VRML97 or X3D keyword").<br>
The file parser.y do the grammatical analysis (detect and prove, if the
tokens found by the lexical analysis form valid VRML/X3DV contructions 
(like Node or ROUTE statements). If some tokens of the grammar are valid,
the action part of the command in the parser.y file create the matching
VRML Nodes, Numbers etc.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to Doug Sanden, white_dune can also parse XML encoded X3D files.
This is done via the expat library.
</p>
<h2><a name="dangerous">Dangerous constructs</a></h2>
<p>
The buildin stringtype ("MyString") can be misleading, it act very
pointerlike. For example be carefull about constructs like the following:
<br>
<pre>
  MyString str = node->getProto()->getName();
  str += "something";                         // also appended to the name... 
</pre>
This do not only copy the name of a Proto of "node" to str and append
"something" to it, it also appends "something" to the name of a Proto !
<p>
</p>
In this situation, it is better to use something like
<pre>
  MyString str = strdup(node->getProto()->getName());
  str += "something"; 
</pre>
or
<pre>
  MyString str = "";
  str += node->getProto()->getName();
  str += "something"; 
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Another dangerous constructs are the constructors for MF* types with pointers
to multiple data of the basic datatype. This is already described 
<a href="#wrong_field_data">in a chapter above</a>.
</p>
<h2><a name="new_node_cookbook">"Adding a new node to white_dune"-cookbook</a></h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Select a name of the new node (here "Something")
<br><br>
<li> add a ID_NEW_SOMETHING to resource.h.m4, usually via adding a new m4 macro
     M4_ID(SOMETHING) 
<br><br>
<li> Add
<br><pre> 
  MENUITEM "Something",                  ID_NEW_SOMETHING
</pre>
  in the matching submenu of the POPUP "&Create" menu and and
<br><pre> 
      ID_NEW_SOMETHING      "Create a new Something Scripted PROTO\nSomething Scripted"
</pre>
  to all src/dune.*.rc files. See <a href="#localisation">the chapter about 
  localisation</a> for more informations about handling the needed language 
  translations.
<br><br>
<li>
  add a 
  <ul>
    <li>VRML_SOMETHING for VRML97 nodes</li>
    <li>X3D_SOMETHING for X3D nodes</li>
    <li>COVER_SOMETHING for extensions of the cover VRML browser</li>
    <li>KAMBI_SOMETHING for extensions of the kambi VRML gameengine</li>
    <li>DUNE_SOMETHING for scripted protos and all other extension nodes</li>
  </ul>
  to the matching 
  place (sorted by SOMETHING in the alphabet) to the matching enum in Node.h

<br><br>
<li> add a
<br><pre>
   addOrReplace(protos, "Something", new ProtoSomething(scene), add);
</pre>
  in a matching place (sorted by the alphabet of the SOMETHING in the list 
  in Node.h) in the function SceneProtoMap::createProtoMap and add
<br><pre>
  #include "NodeSomething.h"
</pre>
  to SceneProtoMap.cpp
<br><br>
<li> copy a similar Node*.h/cpp to NodeSomething.h/cpp and change
  the fields/EventIns and draw, setHandle etc. functions.<br>
  Do not forget to change the getType() function.
<br><br>
<li> in case the new node is always insertable (as a usual geometry node) add a
<br><pre>
  { DUNE_SOMETHING,       ID_NEW_SOMETHING, true, true },
</pre>
  (you may replace DUNE_SOMETHING with VRML_SOMETHING or X3D_SOMETHING)
  to the matching NodeButton arrays in MainWindow.cpp<br>
  In case the new node is not always insertable (like a texture node, which
  requires a Appearance node) add something similar to 
<br><pre>
  { DUNE_SOMETHING,       ID_NEW_SOMETHING, false, true },
</pre>
  to MainWindows.cpp and add something like
<br><pre>
          case DUNE_SOMETHING:
            valid = node->findValidFieldType(VRML_REQUIRED_BY_SOMETHING) != -1;
            break;
</pre>
  to the swich in MainWindow::UpdateToolbar(STOOLBAR toolbar, Node *node, 
  int field, NodeButton *buttons, int count) 
<br><br>
<li>Use gimp to include a new icon (16 pixels width) of your node 
     (nodenames need to be sorted by the alphabet) into res/node_icons.bmp
     (or res_color/node_icons.bmp for UNIX type compilation with configure)
     <br><br>
  Warning: DO NOT change the numbers of colors in this bitmap file !
     <br><br>
  When you have gimp version 1.2 installed as "gimp", you can 
  use the script "batch/inserticon.sh" under Linux/UNIX/MacOSX by typing
<BR><pre>
         sh batch/inserticon.sh DUNE_SOMETHING
</pre>
  or
<BR><pre>
         sh batch/inserticon.sh X3D_SOMETHING
</pre>
  gimp will then open and select the matching node icons that has to be
  moved 16 pixels to left. Use "edit->cut" and "edit->paste" then move
  the icons to the left border of the gimp window. Draw your new icon
  in the new 16 pixels wide white gap.   
<br><br>
<li> add a
<BR><pre>
        case ID_NEW_SOMETHING:
          CreateNode("Something");
          break;
</pre>
  to MainWindow::OnCommand(int id) in MainWindow.cpp<br>
  You may need to replace CreateNode("Something"); by 
  CreateGeometryNode("Something"); for a geometry node or you need to
  replace it with InsertNode(DUNE_SOMETHING, "Something"); for a node,
  that can only be inserted depending on the current node.
<br><br>
<li> In case of a new scripted node: it makes only sense with a VRML97 PROTO 
     statement.
     Put your PROTO into the docs/scriptedNodes directory. 
<br><br>
<li> add the name of NodeSomething.o file into the matching place
     in the src/Makefile.in file.
     Add NodeSomething.cpp to the M$Windows project or add it as a include
     into src/FilesMissingInWindowsProjects.cpp
<br><br>
<li> Do not forget the GPL license, which forces you to public somehow
     the complete sources, if you want to redistribute a modified version 
     of white_dune...

<h2><a name="wonderland_export">Open Wonderland export</a></h2>
<p>
White_dune is able to write the VRML97/X3D scenegraph data in the programming 
languages C, C++ and java. The resulting data can be used in other programs, 
e.g. to render the data with a own OpenGL program. There are a lot of visable 
nodes in VRML97/X3D, so there is away to convert primitive (e.g. Box) or 
parametric (e.g. NurbsPatchSurface) shapes to mesh data. It is also possible 
to convert to triangulated mesh data. All visible shapes classes (except 
shape classes not rendered by white_dune yet and the class of the "Text" node)
are children of the MeshBasedNode class, which handles the conversion.
Animateable shapes (like Nurbs(Patch)Surface) are children of the 
MeshMorphingNode class, which is able to create morphing animation data
for the resulting mesh data. The MeshMorphingNode class is also a child
of the MeshBasedNode class.<br>
White_dune can also directly write the needed java sourcecode to render
VRML97/X3D data in the Open Wonderland multiuser server.<br>
This includes features like animation, scripting and interaction.<br>
See the <a href="../usage_docs/dune_1.html">man page of white_dune</a> 
for more information.<br>
Unfortunatly, there are a lot of nodes, which are not supported by
the wonderland exporter. Each node can be written as a java class, but it
makes a remarkable difference to the java compiler (with respect to 
memory usage and compile time) if the classes of the unsupported nodes
are written or not. Therefore, the optimization option to avoid unsupported
nodes is now per default in use. Unsupported nodes found in the X3D file 
are also written, but developers who wish to implement the support for
such a node may need either always switch off the optimization or 
mark this node as supported by the Wonderland exporter in the white_dune 
sources.<br>
The interface of a node is defined in class named e.g. "ProtoSomeNodeName"
in the file NodeSomeNodeName.cpp.<br>
The "ProtoSomeNodeName" class is a (direct or indirect) child of a class named 
"Proto". To mark a node as supported by the Wonderland exporter replace the 
"Proto" class name in the ProtoSomeNodeName definition
<br>
<pre>

<h2><a name="localisation">Localisation: translating the program to foreign 
    languages</a></h2>
<p>
It requires absolute no programming skills to translate the program to a 
foreign language, if the foreign languages uses ASCII characters:<br>
you only need to copy the file "src/dune.english.rc" into a similar file,
use a texteditor with search and replace und at end translate the strings
in this file to the foreign language.<br>
</p>
<p>
The problems when trying to translate the program to a foreign
language with non ASCII characters (like chinease UTF8 characters) are
untested/unknown.
</p>
<p>
To complete the task to create a new runnable program a compatible compiler
is needed. Of course, this task can be done (after publicing the main
translation file src/dune.something.rc) by a programmer later, it do not need to 
be done by the translator.<br>
All "src/dune.*.rc" files are copied together into one src/dune.rc file during the 
run of "configure" and "make".<br>
This means, that for creating a new runnable program, you need either a 
UNIX like system (e.g. Linux or MacOSX) or a bunch of unixtools:<br>
m4, make, cat, grep and sh (e.g. bash or ksh).<br>
A complete free/opensource installable collection of unixtools for M$Windows 
is called cygwin and is available for free from the internet.<br>
</p>
<p>
For Translaton, first search the ISO 3166 two characters of your language
(e.g. "en" for english, "de" for german, "it" for italian, etc...)
and build the uppercase version of this characters (e.g. EN for english,
DE for german, IT for italian, etc).
</p>
<p>
Second, select a src/dune.something.rc file. In the simpler case, do not select
"src/dune.english.rc" cause this requires more complicated search and replace
commands.<br>
<ul>
 <li>
  In case of translating "src/dune.english.rc", you have to replace the following
  characters in the whole file:<br>
  <ul>
   <li>IDR_ with IDR_DE_ for german, IDR_ with IDR_IT_ for italian etc</li>
   <li>IDD_ with IDD_DE_ for german, IDD_ with IDD_IT_ for italian etc</li>
   <li>IDS_ with IDS_DE_ for german, IDS_ with IDS_IT_ for italian etc</li>
  </ul>
  Now search for the first occurance of STRINGTABLE DISCARDABLE in 
  src/dune.english.rc and replace (starting at this point)<br>
  <ul>
   <li>ID_ with ID_DE_ for german, ID_ with ID_IT_ for italian etc</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>
  In case of translating a other "src/dune.*.rc" than "src/dune.english.rc", you 
  simply have to replace the term _??_ in the whole file, where ?? marks
  the uppercase ISO 3166 two characters. E.g. if you translate 
  "src/dune.german.rc" to "src/dune.italian.rc", you have to replace _DE_ with
  _IT_ in the whole file, thats all.
 </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Third you need to translate all the strings in the new src/dune.something.rc file.
A so called string is a term that starts with a " and ends with a "<br>
For example, the translation of the line from src/dune.english.rc
<BR><pre>
    POPUP "&File"
</pre>
to german language in src/dune.german.rc would result in
<BR><pre>
    POPUP "&Datei"
</pre>
where the german word Datei is the translation of the english word File.
The "&" sign marks the keyboard shortcut. The next character after "&"
should not be ambient in the same level of a menu.
</p>
<p>
After the translation of the strings is ready, the translation step is
ready. On a Linux/UNIX/MacOSX/cygwin system with the gawk (GNU awk) program 
you can use 
<BR><pre>
sh test/testmenus.sh
</pre>
one the commandline to use some consistency testing of the new rc file.
</p>
<p>
The new file src/dune.something.rc can be now publiced (e.g. in a usenet
group like comp.lang.vrml, or at 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=3356&atid=103356">the 
sourceforge site for the original dune project</a>).
</p>
<p>
For a recompilation, you first need to extend the list of lanugages, 
white_dune understands.<br>
Currently you need to extend the list of known languages in the file
src/swt/include/languages.m4. E.g. to extend the list of known 
languages from english (empty default) and german (DE) in 
src/swt/include/languages.m4
<BR><pre>
define(`M4_LANGUAGES_CONFIG',`
DE,german')
</pre>
to english, italian (IT) and german, then change the list to
<BR><pre>
define(`M4_LANGUAGES_CONFIG',`
IT,italian,
DE,german')
</pre>
or extent to english, italian and spanish (ES) and german, then change the list
to
<BR><pre>
define(`M4_LANGUAGES_CONFIG',`
IT,italian,
ES,spanish,
DE,german')
</pre>
Take care that the last language line (here with "DE,german") do not end
with a comma.
</p>
<p>
It is also possible to change the yes/no strings in Linux/UNIX messageboxes.
E.g. you extend the yes/no strings from english and german in 
src/swt/include/languages.m4 
<BR><pre>
define(M4_YES_english,"yes")
define(M4_YES_german,"Ja")

define(M4_NO_english,"no")
define(M4_NO_german,"Nein")
</pre>
with the yes/no strings of italian, you have to change 
src/swt/include/languages.m4 to
<BR><pre>
define(M4_YES_english,"yes")
define(M4_YES_italian,"si")
define(M4_YES_german,"Ja")

define(M4_NO_english,"no")
define(M4_NO_italian,"no")
define(M4_NO_german,"Nein")
</pre>
</p>
<p>
The final step is rebuilding the needed files for compilation. On a 
Linux/UNIX/MacOSX/cygwin system, this is done automatically by using 
"sh build.sh"<br>
(or "configure && make").<br>
On other systems, at least a text editor and a port of the m4 program is 
required.<br>
With the texteditor, copy all dune.*.rc files together and store the
result in the file "dune.rc"<br>
With m4 you need to execute the following commands in the src directory:<br>
<br>
m4 resource.h.m4 &gt; resource.h<br>
m4 CommandlineLanguages.h.m4 &gt; CommandlineLanguages.h<br>
</p>
<p>
After recompilation (see the file INSTALL for details), the new language can 
be used with a commandline parameter.
The name of the new commandline parameter is the minus sign followed by
the second word in the new line in M4_LANGUAGES_CONFIG.<br>
E.g. if you added "IT,italian," to M4_LANGUAGES_CONFIG, the new commandline
parameter to switch to the italien language is -italien
</p>
<p>
All that have to be done now is to add the new commandline parameter to the 
documentation in the manpage file man/dune.1
</p>
<h2><a name="programmer_localisation">Localisation from a programmers point 
of view </a></h2>
<p>
When handling text messages from a programmers point of view, always try to 
use the function "swLoadString" to get a language related string (e.g. for a 
errormessage) from the "src/dune.rc" file. The first argument of the 
swLoadString file is a identifier, like IDS_INTERNAL_ERROR, which refers to 
the message in the default (english) language. To get the current language 
translation, add the term TheApp->getLang() to the idenifier, e.g . with 
swLoadString(IDS_INTERNAL_ERROR + TheApp->getLang(),...
</p>
<p>
As a programmer, take care about the fact, that each program code 
modification (e.g. addition of new menu items) in one of the 
src/dune.something.rc 
files requires the change of a all other "src/dune.somelanguage.rc" files.<br>
Cause a programmer is usually not a multilingual genius, the addition of
a new menuitem, icon tooltip or errormessage comes with a translation 
problem. There are two possible solutions: either use a dictionary/internet 
translation service like babelfish.altavista.com, or leave the english 
word in the src/dune.something.rc file and hope for modification by users.<br>
To leave the line blank cause of a unknown foreign word is not a option,
cause this can result in a crash of the program when used in this foreign
language.<br>
The addition of a new icon tooltip or errormessage also requires the
inclusion of a new "#define" command which can be usually found in the 
resource.h file.<br>
Do not change the resource.h file directly. The file resource.h is a 
autogenerated file, that could be overwritten at each run of the "make" 
command or "configure" command.<br>
