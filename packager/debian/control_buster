Description: Graphical X3D/VRML97 editor, simple NURBS/Superformula 3D modeller and  animation tool
 white_dune is:
 - a graphical editor to load/create/store X3D/VRML97 files
 - a simple NURBS/Superformula/Subdivision based 3D modeller
 - a 3D animation tool
 - a commandline X3D/VRML97 compiler
 - a program with (currently) 3 different GUIs
 - a program for beginners/children to create their first 3D animation ("-4kids")
 - a tool (and examples) that supports you in learning X3D or VRML97
 - a tool to load static/animated X3D/VRML97 files (directly or via "Inline"
   commands) created by programs like maya, 3D Studio MAX, Cinema4D, blender, 
   wings3d, art of illusion etc. and add interaction/scripting 
 - a tool to manipulate 3D data with 3D input devices (e.g. joystick/spaceball)
