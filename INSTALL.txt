SOURCE INSTALLATION FOR Linux/UNIX/MacOSX
=========================================

In short, just extract the source archive (* is the version number)

$ bzip2 -cd wdune-*.tar.bz2 | tar -xvf -

Change the directory to the created directory

$ cd  wdune-*

Type

$ sh build.sh

If all development packages are installed you can start the program with

$ ../bin/dune

If not all development packages are installed, read on

BINARY INSTALLATION FOR Linux/UNIX/MacOSX
=========================================

You may want to check, if you can get installable packages/binaries for 
your operation system under 
http://wdune.ourproject.org
or
https://snapcraft.io/wdune (Linux snap package)

To get rid of deprecated configuration information (from a older install)
after installation, you may need to remove $HOME/.dunerc


BINARY INSTALLATION FOR M$Windows
=================================

white_dune under M$Windows do not have a installation procedure. 
It should run on all "win32 compatible" windows versions from scratch (except 
early versions of Windows 95, which requires the installation of OpenGL first). 

Currently there are only 64 Bit binary versions of white_dune for 
Windows 7 or Windows 10 available. These are "win32 compatible".
If you need a 32 Bit version or older Windows version of white_dune, 
you have to build it and the needed libraries from source.

white_dune under M$Windows usually stores some configuration information in 
the user section of the registry. It is possible to remove this information 
with the commandline argument "-uninstall", eg. by typing
    path\to\dune.exe -uninstall
on the commandline.
You may need to run this after installation to get rid of deprecated 
configuration information.

If you want to store the configuration information in a file instead of the
windows registry, you can set the environment variable DUNERC.
This makes it possible to run white_dune from a CD/USB-Stick without touching 
the windows registry with a additional batchfile like

set DUNERC=%~d0:\dune.rc 
%~d0:\dune.exe

This is usefull on (misconfigured ?) M$Windows installations which 
forbid the modification of the windows registry completely.

To get rid of deprecated configuration information (from a older install)
after installation, you may need to start 

w*dune-*.exe -uninstall 

(in the Micro$oft Windows commandline).


BUILD INSTRUCTIONS FOR UNIX/Linux:
----------------------------------

If there is no systemdependend install mechanism, white_dune
can be installed with "./configure && make -j8" and the source directory 
should not be deleted, as it contains the help/PROTO files.

The building of systemdependend binary packages is done in the "packager" 
directory.

Systems supported by "packager" directory
=========================================

 You need to install a lot of libraries, see the next section for information.

 For MacOSX, the needed static static libraries (and headers) are available at
 ftp://ftp.ourproject.org/pub/wdune/macosx_static_inc_libs.tar.gz
 For MacOSX 10.2 "jaguar"/MacOSX 10.3 "Panther" you need "X11 for MacOSX" and 
 the matching X11 SDK package. 
 More modern MacOSX systems usually install "X11 for MacOSX" and the X11 SDK 
 package is available on installation media.
 For current MacOSX systems you have to install XQuartz 
 (https://www.xquartz.org) from the internet.

 For MacOSX use:
     (cd packager/macosx && sh mksit.sh)

 For IRIX 6.5 use (as root):
     (cd packager/irix && sh mkpkg.sh)

 For SUN (Open)Solaris use:
     (cd packager/solaris && sh mkpkg.sh)

 For FreeBSD use (as root):
     (cd packager/freebsd && sh mkpkg.sh)

 For Redhat/Fedora Linux (and possibly other rpm based systems):
     (cd packager/rpm && sh mkrpm.sh)

 For OpenSuse (and possibly other rpm based systems) use:
     (cd packager/rpm && sh mkrpm_opensuse.sh)

 For Debian Linux (stable) use as root:
     (cd packager/debian && sh mkdeb_buster.sh)
 See README_debian.txt for more information

 For Ubuntu Linux (LTS) use:
     (cd packager/debian && sh mkdeb_ubuntu.sh)

 For Slackware Linux use:
     (cd packager/slackware && sh mkpkg.sh)

 For Arch Linux use:
     (cd packager/archlinux && mkpacman.sh)

 For AIX 4.3 (RS/6000) you need mklpp from the bull freeware collection 
    http://www.bullfreeware.com/download/aix43/bull.mklpp-1.2.9.0.exe
 use:
     (cd packager/aix && sh mkbff.sh)
     
 Under Ubuntu Linux you can try (as root):
     (cd packager/snap && sh mksnap.sh)
 You need to install "snapcraft", the result is a "snap" package that
 installs under several Linux distributions

You will find the binary package files either in /tmp or in the usual 
systemdependend place like /usr/src/Redhat or $HOME/lppdir/bff 

On some systems (e.g. freebsd) you need to copy the vcglib directory
(http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/vcglib/) into the wdune directory.
On some systems it is sufficent to have the vcglib directory in the
$HOME directory.
Watch the output of configure, if it would find the vcglib.

Non root or if your Systems is not (yet) supported by the packager directory
============================================================================

To compile under Unix, you need at least to the development versions of

- OpenGL/Mesa3D 
- Motif/OpenMotif/Lesstif 

There is a minor difference between some older versions of motif and modern 
versions of openmotif and lesstif.
This problem occured first with some lesstif versions and was solved with a 
configure option "--with-buginlesstif". 
This has now be changed to a compatibility option for old motif version:
"--with-oldmotif".

For example if you use the "--with-oldmotif" option with 
lesstif 0.92.26 version delivered at /opt/sfw under Solaris 8 or some 
versions of openmotif, this can cause problems. The most common problem 
is that nothing works if you click to a icon.

Under IRIX 6.5 use the "--with-oldmotif" option.

Someone reported problems with the fileselector in debians lesstif 0.93.18-4
version. Use openmotif instead.

There is also a problem with openmotif 2.3.4 (dune crashes (harmless) if the 
tab character is pressed). Use lesstif instead.

It is recommended to have the development version of libjpeg, libpng, zlib,
expat and freetype2 installed. If white_dune is linked with libjpeg, this 
software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group.

Additionally, the CGAL and VCGlib libraries are used for the convex hull,
CSG and polygon reducer functionality. The headers only version of this 
VCGlib is sufficent.

Another library is the cURL library, it can be used to download VRML/X3D
files from the internet (and matching texture files, sound files, Inlines 
and EXTERPROTOs).

It is not recommended to link the "freeglut" libraries, cause the program 
can exit with a emergency save to the file named "$HOME/.dune_crash*.wrl"
when try to display a VRML97 Text node.
As a workaround, white_dune included a few routines from the OpenGLUT
library as sources, so you do not need to link any GLUT libraries any more.

A needed library is the freetype2 library, it is used for Text/Text3D
rendering.

Needed libraries are the ffmpeg libraries, they are used for MovieTexture
rendering. Unfortunatly, the ffmpeg libraries are not available under
Fedora Linux, M$Windows and MacOSX, so there is no MovieTexture rendering. 

A not real needed library is the Devil library. It is usefull, if your
VRML browser supports image formats like TGA (like the covise VRML
browser), but this makes the image selection dialog more complicated.
So it is a good idea to use "./configure --without-devil". 

A useful library is the OpenSubdiv CPU library. It is used for mesh 
subdivision. If this library is not available, a older subdivision
routine is used, but the OpenSubdiv routine has better results if the
mesh has holes.

If you have a spaceball device connected to the serial port, it is 
recommended to have the development version of libsball installed.

If you own a Mindstorms NXT device, you can attach a wheel/gear to each of
3 Mindstorm NXT motors and use the system as USB driven dials device. 
To use it, you need the development version of libusb (e.g. version 0.1).
libusb by itself may need additional configuration, eg. a pseudo-filesystem 
known as 'usbdevfs` or 'usbfs` mounted under /proc/bus/usb under Linux.
To access the libusb functions, you may need additional configurations, e.g.
a modification of the udev configuration under Linux (google for the terms
"usblib udev nxt") to get access to the USB device without root rights.
You can also try tools/nxt_udev.sh as root.

For a complete selftest, it is recommended to have bmptopnm from the netpbm
package installed.

Note, that dune may fail to compile/run with buggy gcc CVS snapshots called 
"gcc-2.96" (to find out run "gcc -v") which is delivered with some older 
Redhat/Linux distributions. See "--with-kgcc" option below.

Dune also may fail to compile with some (all ?) "ecgs" g++ compilers, 
g++ 2.91.66 is the last "ecgs" compiler (to find out run "g++ -v") 

Dune has been successfully compiled with
- gcc/g++ 7.2.1
- gcc/g++ 4.3.2
- gcc/g++ 4.0.0 (MacOSX)
- gcc/g++ 3.3.6
- gcc/g++ 3.2.1
- gcc/g++ 2.95.3
- gcc/g++ 2.95.2
- gcc/g++ 2.8.1
- gcc/g++ 7.3.0
- gcc/g++ 8.2.1
- gcc/g++ 8.3.0
- gcc/g++ 8.3.1
- clang 6.0.1
- Apple LLVM version 7.3.0
- MIPSpro 7.30 (SGI IRIX)
- Sun WorkShop 6 update 2 C/C++ 5.3 (SUN SOLARIS) (make depend fails (harmless))
- HP ANSI C++ B3910B A.03.55/HP92453-01 B.11.11.10 HP C Compiler (HP-UX)
- DEC cxx compiler

It is unknown, if dune compiles with the AIX xlc/xlC compilers, but it
compiles with AIX gcc/g++.

On some versions of the MacOSX development system ("Xcode") it is important
to click to the "UNIX Development Support" button during the installation
of the MacOSX development/Xcode package. Otherwise it gets difficult to
compile even simple things with gcc/g++ on the commandline.
Modern MacOSX Versions use clang/clang++ instead of gcc/g++.

UNIX/Linux compile procedure
============================

If you got a .tar.bz2 file then you can extract it with

$ bzip2 -cd white_dune-whatever.tar.bz2 | tar -xvf -

and change into the main directory with

$ cd white_dune-whatever

To compile run 

$ rm -f config.cache
$ sh ./configure --with-somethingbelow --without-somethingbelow 
$ make

You can then use bin/dune or copy it to a folder of you own. The docs
directory should remain at the current location.

A typical configure line when compiling on a typical UNIX/Linux system is

$ sh ./configure --with-optimization --without-devil

There are a few build*.sh scripts in the main directory of white_dune.

If the "configure" command fail mysterically, it is strongly recommended to 
read the file config.log
Under some circumstances, the "configure" command "lie": e.g. when your 
disk is full a test for a library routine can fail cause the compiler can not 
write it's internal files.

After compilation, you can run some internal selftests for white_dune with

$ make selftest

A note for the compile with the OLPC
------------------------------------

The OLPC ("One Laptop Per Child") is a computer especially special tailored
for school usage in third world countries. It's Linux based operation system
is not comparable to conventional Linux distributions.
It is possible to build white_dune binary packages for and on the usual 
Linux version of the OLPC, but you have to struggle with some unusual 
problems (at least on the "XO-1" model of the OLPC):

- The original OLPC system do not have development tools like gcc, g++ etc.
  Each OLPC version is based on a matching Fedora Linux version, often older
  then the current Fedora version. e.g. for OLPC Linux version 11.3.0
  the matching Fedora version is 14, while the current Fedora version
  at the same time is 15 or 16. 
  For OLPC Linux version 11.3.0 you need to install Fedora Linux 14 
  development packages.
  To create a proper development and testing environment, the libraries
  of the original OLPC system should remain untouched. 
  Most simplest solution:
  - become the "root" user with "su"
  - Get two USB harddisks. 
  - Format the harddisks with a fullfeatured Linux filesystem like ext2 
    (eg. with something like "mkfs -t ext2 /dev/sdb1").
  - plug out the harddisks
  - plug in the first harddisk, it get mounted under /media/something
  - copy /lib/* to the root level of the first harddisk 
  - umount your first harddisk
  - mount your first harddisk to /lib (e.g. "mount /dev/sda1 /lib")
  - plug in the second harddisk, it get mounted under /media/somethingother
  - copy /usr/lib/* to the root level of the second harddisk 
  - umount your second harddisk
  - mount your second harddisk to /usr/lib (e.g. "mount /dev/sdb1 /usr/lib")
  - you are now ready to install additional development tools
    (e.g. via matching fedora RPM-files from the net or from a USB 
    cdrom/dvd drive). Sometimes the version of the development RPM (header)
    files from fedora do not match the version of the RPM files from the
    OLPC system. In this case you can try to install the development package
    without version checking ("using the argument "--nodeps" for "rpm -i")
  - later you can unmount the library directories and test against the
    usual libraries

- The fedora shared OpenGL libraries (at least several) are not working
  on the OLPC Linux. Like other modern Linux-OpenGL versions, this 
  libraries depend on code placed in the X-lib libraries. On the OLPC, this 
  code has been optimized away, making this OpenGL libraries useless.
  Solution:
  - compile a older version of the Mesa3D library, that do not use code
    in the X-lib libraries eg. Mesa 6.4.2 
  - compile only to static libraries (via "./configure")
  - link white_dune with this static libraries

- The OLPC XO-1 model do not have enought virtual memory for the final
  link step when creating the white_dune binary. This can easily result
  in a system crash of the OLPC system.
  Solutions:
  - either run "telinit single" before compile to switch off the memory 
    consuming processes of the default system and compile on a virtual
    console (with very small fonts)
  - or mount a USB hard disk, create a large swap file on it and activate
    this swap file
    WARNING: It is not a good idea to create a swap file on the OLPC
             SSD "harddisk". This type of media do only support a limited
             number of write accesses. Using a often written swapfile on
             this type of media can decrease the lifetime of the SSD "disk".

A note for people who want to generate a own white_dune package from scratch:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The configure procedure will set the defaults for documentation and
 needed VRML proto files to the current source directory.
 If you want to delete the source directory after package generation, it would
 be a good idea to use the --with-helpurl and --with-protobaseurl configure 
 options according to the location of the installed documentation directory.

Additionally you may want to download the ISO 14772 (VRML97) document 
http://www.web3d.org/x3d/specifications/vrml/ISO-IEC-14772-IS-VRML97WithAmendment1/part1/nodesRef.html
and use the configure option --with-vrmlnodesurl

"sh ./configure --help" gives you a list of available options.

--with-dontcarefocus              moved into commandline parameters
--with-aflock                     now always true

                                                         development)

===============
--with-oldmotif
===============

Used for compatibility with old motif/lesstif versions. 
Newer versions of openmotif/lesstif differ from older motif versions.
The negation of this configure option was formerly --with-buginlesstif.        
--with-buginlesstif was needed, if a click to a icon did not work.

===============
--without-devil
===============

Do not use DevIL library to load textureimages.
The DevIL library is a wrapper library, it can be used to load different 
imageformats like TIFF, BMP, TGA, MNG, XPM, PCX, PNM, etc.
It is not sure, if your target VRML browser support this imageformats,
cause the VRML97 standard only demand support for JPEG and PNG image file 
formats and recommend GIF. 
It looks like some of the supported imageformats of the DevIL library
do not work on big endian machines (e.g. Apple PowerMac, Sun SPARC, SGI MIPS)

================
--without-ffmpeg
================

Do not use the ffmpeg libraries to render MovieTexture.
The ffmpeg libraries are not available on Fedora Linux, MacOSX and Microsoft
Windows.

==============
--without-cgal
==============

Do not use the CGAL library. CGAL is used for important modelling functions
like "convex hull". It is usefull to compile without CGAL cause a lot of
CGAL implemantations crashes the valgrind memory debugger.

=============
--without-omp
=============

Do not use OpenMP. OpenMP speeds up the Array.find() routine, but on
system like raspberry PI it tends to overheat the processors.

============================
--without-png_handle_unknown 
============================

In some cases, the usage of png_handle_unknown cause linkerproblems, or
the usage itself is not recommended. 

==================
--with-sdljoystick      
==================

Use SDL joystick code. In some cases, the code borrowed from the
SDL library to handle joystick events causes problems.

========================
--with-helpurl="helpurl"
========================               

URL of the "docs" directory. 
Default: "docs" directory of the source package.
also available at http://wdune.ourproject.org/docs/

==================================
--with-vrmlnodesurl="vrmlnodesurl"     
==================================

URL of ISO standard vrml97 node list. 

Default: 
http://www.web3d.org/x3d/specifications/vrml/ISO-IEC-14772-IS-VRML97WithAmendment1/part1/nodesRef.html
Download the ISO standard vrml97 pages to avoid unnecessary internet
communication costs.

==============================
--with-protobaseurl="protourl"
==============================

URL of base directory of PROTOs for needed EXTERNPROTO statements.
dune use per default the URL of the local directory "docs" containing
as "protourl". 
You can replace this URL of the PROTO with a other location.

Under the url "protourl" the following directories are expected (currently):

- vrml97Amendment1

Currently, the VRML97 Amendment1 NURBS nodes (e.g. NurbsSurface, 
NurbsCurve or NurbsGroup) are not supported by all VRML97 browsers. 
There are working NurbsSurface implementations in the cc3d (blaxxun contact) 
and cortona VRML97 browsers.
In the docs/vrml97Amendment1 directory of the white_dune sources,
there is a javascript implementation of the NurbsSurface, NurbsCurve
and NurbsGroup node that works (at least) with the cosmoplayer 2.? VRML97 
browser.
When using the Amendment1 NurbsSurface, NurbsCurve or NurbsGroup node, 
dune additionally write a reference to the urn's of cc3d and cortona
to the EXTERNPROTO statement.

- x3d

Similar to the vrml97Amendment1 directory, for a VRML97 implementation for
nodes orginating from the X3D standard.
In the docs/x3dDraft directory of the white_dune sources,
there is a javascript implementation of the LoadSensor node that works
(at least) with the cosmoplayer 2.? VRML97 browser. This is only a weak
emulation of the X3D draft LoadSensor node, it do not work with all 
VRML97 browser.

- ScriptedNodes

Similar to the vrml97Amendment1 directory, for nodes which are only implemented
via script Nodes. 
In the docs/scriptedNodes directory of the white_dune sources,
there are the javascript implementation of this nodes that work
(at least) with the cosmoplayer 2.? and cc3dglut 4.3 browser.
For the SuperEllipsoid and SuperShape it is not very useful, to 
use the javascript implementation for morping animations. 

- scriptedNodes

This directory is needed for compatibility with older versions 
(< white_dune-029beta546) of the script Nodes. 
This directory holds the PROTO interfaces for old scripted nodes.
Old files using the old script nodes can be read by a newer white_dune
version and will be converted to the newer format.

- coverNodes

Somewhat similar to the vrml97Amendment1 directory, but for unportable 
nodes of the immersive cover/covise VRML browser (only useable when
dune is started with the "-cover" option.
The PROTOs in the matching directory are only placeholders, they do nothing.

- exportContainers      

Somewhat similar to the vrml97Amendment1 directory, for nodes which act
as containers for data needed for other fileformats than VRML/X3D 
(e.g. catt 8).

=============
--with-debian
=============

Optimize library usage for debian, e.g. the libdl library is not needed.

============================
--with-x3domurl=\"x3domurl\"
============================

URL to X3DOM support files

================
--with-coverwave
================

Allow creation of deprecated nonstandard extension node Wave of the cover 
browser.

==================
--with-covertuimap
==================
 
Allow creation of incomplete nonstandard extension node TUIMap the cover 
browser.

============================
--with-wwwbrowser=wwwbrowser
============================

Use this to configure your default wwwbrowser to view HTML (help) files. 
Examples are netscape mozilla opera etc.

==============================
--with-vrmlbrowser=vrmlbrowser
==============================

Use this to configure your default vrmlbrowser to view VRML files.
This can be needed if your default wwwbrowser (like netscape) has no 
vrml plugin (like the one from FreeWRL) installed and you use a 
standalone vrml browser program (like lookat) instead.

========================
--with-x11-editor=editor   
========================

Use this to configure your default X11 text editor eg. gvim gedit ...
If no texteditor is found, a xterm clone is used with "-e vi".
I recommend to use the lxterminal xterm clone with
"lxterminal --no-remote -e vi"
If you want to use a outer tty based editor like "nano", simply use e.g.
"lxterminal --no-remote -e nano"
in options->Text/Object Editor Settings...

==============================
--with-imageeditor=imageeditor 
==============================

Use this to configure your default program to change JPEG and PNG bitmap 
(.jpg/.png/.gif) files 
eg. gimp kolourpaint xpaint imgworks...

==============================
--with-soundeditor=soundeditor
==============================

Use this to configure your default program to change for WAVe sound 
(.wav) files 
eg. audacity rezound wavesurfer gnusound sweep soundeditor...

==============================
--with-movieeditor=movieeditor 
==============================

Use this to configure your default program to change MPEG 1 movie 
(.mpeg) files 
eg. cinelerra avidemux2 avidemux moviemaker...

====================================
--with-checkincommand=checkincommand 
====================================

Default check in command of a revision control system.
The check command of a revision control system stores repetitive new versions 
of a file. Later all versions can be restored.
If a check in command is present and the use of the check in command 
is enabled via "Options -> output settings", white_dune use a check in
command for every store of a VRML/X3D file.
Via "Options -> output settings" a user can change the check in command.
A check in command must be either noninteractive or must open a graphics
window. You need to replace the filename to store with %s.
Currently configure search for the ci command of the RCS revision control 
system and use "ci -l -q -f %s < /dev/null"

================
--without-stereo
================

If your system is capable to do quadbuffer stereo, but you do not have
shutterglases or a similar technology, use --without-stereo to disable
the default stereomode.

====================================
--with-stereocommand="stereocommand"
====================================

On some systems, you need a extra command to switch to a quadbuffer stereo
capable visual.

To see your if the current visual is capable for stereo, use the "glxinfo" 
command and look at the "st" column (for details see the manpage).

On some systems, a 1280x1024 resolution mode is not stereo capable.

To switch on a SGI from a 1280x1024 mode to a stereocabable 1024x768 mode, 
use a command like "/usr/gfx/setmon -n 1024x768_96s" or 
"/usr/gfx/setmon -x 1024x768_96s". On some older systems, setmon commands
to switch resolution ("setmon -x") are only accepted from root and the 
X server must be restarted to complete the operation.

For example a SGI Indigo2 IMPACT/1/1/1 ("High Impact") system in 1024x678_76 
videomode can find a visual with quadbuffer stereo, but the monitor must be 
switched to a matching mode with the command: 
"/usr/gfx/setmon -n 1024x768_96s"
Using the --with-stereocommand option, this can be done by starting dune.

=========================
--without-usrlocalinclude  
=========================

Some of the gcc 3.X compiler versions refuse to accept the -I/usr/local/include 
option. In this case a lot of configure tests will fail mysterically if
you do not read config.log

===========
--with-kgcc
===========

 If you have the buggy Redhat Linux compilers (gcc CVS snapshot aka "gcc-2.96")
 or buggy SuSE Linux compilers (gcc CVS snapshot aka "gcc-2.96"), use

 $ rm -f config.cache
 $ sh ./configure --with-kgcc
 $ make
 
 The fake "gcc-2.96" compilers have problems to successfull compile code
 with variable argument list (stdarg).

 To install on Linux redhat 7.1 you will find kgcc in a package called 
 "compat-egcs", which need the compat-glibc package (BTW: the lesstif package
 is in the "powertools" directory).

===================
--with-krlikeindent
===================

 Use if you want this 

 Transform {
   children [
     Shape {
       appearance Appearance {
         material Material {
         }
       }
       geometry Cone {
       }
     }
   ]
 }

 Kernigan/Richie like indent (from their C book) instead of this 

 Transform 
   {
   children 
     [
     Shape 
       {
       appearance Appearance 
         {
         material Material 
           {
           }
         }
       geometry Cone 
         {
         }
       }
     ]
   }

 indent.

=================
--with-routeatend
=================

Write ROUTE statements at the end of the VRML file. 
Otherwise (default) ROUTE statements are written at the first possible
place outside nodes.

============================================
--with-uninstallcomment=\"uninstallcomment\" 
============================================

Allows to document a uninstall command for the -uninstall commandline
option, e.g. 

--with-uninstallcomment=\"dpkg -P whitedune\"

====================
--with-eulerrotation
====================

Use if you want to input euler angles (in degrees) as fieldvalues instead 
of VRML like rotations. 
Of course, this option only affects interactive input, not the export or 
import of VRML files.

============================
--with-dontreplacevrmlscript
============================

Some older VRML editors (like cosmoworlds 1.02) use "vrmlscript:"
instead of "javascript:" to sign URL with inlined javascript in Scriptnodes.
If this configure option is not set, white_dune will replace "vrmlscript:" 
with "javascript:" in URLs (to avoid problems with modern VRML browsers).

==================
--with-updatedebug
================== 

Use debug messages to show updates between views/windows. 
Unnecessary updates are a potential performance problem for commands with lots of operations.

==================
--with-aflockdebug         
==================

Use debug messages for the Ascention Flock of birds magnetic headtracker.

===============
--with-coredump
===============

Switch off emergencysave signalhandling.
Useful for testing, or if the signalhandling code do not match your system. 

====================
--with-fpuinterrupts
====================

Switch on interrupts for invalid fpu operations. 
Useful to find numeric errors together with "--with-coredump".

=============
--with-efence
=============
             
Use the efence malloc debugging routines. 
This is useful to find hard to find bugs related to memory allocation. 
Efence requires to start bin/dune from the debugger and the debugger
will stop on problems like writing over a malloced/new memory block.
bin/dune needs very much swapspace when linked to efence.
When the configure command is able to locate the static version of the
efence library, it may be wise to use a other binary build with 
"cd src && make ../bin/efencedune". 
In this case, efence checks only the memory malloced by white_dune itself, 
not the memory malloced by linked libraries like OpenGL, X11 or image reading 
libraries. Therefore the program use remarkable less swapscape and run
remarkable faster as the program linked with --with-efence.

===========
--with-duma
===========
             
Duma is a advanced/already maintained fork of efence. 
For more information see --with-efence.
The matching make command is "cd src && make ../bin/dumadune"

=============
--without-gif
=============

Avoid code to render gif textures. This is useful to support the creation of
true standard conform VRML/X3DV files, despite the GIF format is mentioned 
in the standards as "Support for the GIF format is also recommended".

=============
--without-usb
=============

Avoid code to use libusb, currently only used for the Lego NXT dials 
inputdevice.
This is currently used on SUN Solaris.

=================
--with-testinmenu
=================

This option is only intented for developers of new code, who want to check new 
but do not want to take care about the menu mechanisms.
Look for MainWindow::testInMenu() in MainWindow.cpp to see how to use this 
menupoint.

==========
--with-cut
==========

Tries to make use of the "edit -> cut" menupoint in dune. This is known
to cause problems. Currently you better use the copy/paste/delete 
menupoints instead. Use this option only, if you want to try to write a bugfix.

====================
--without-textedit  
====================

Use this as a workaround, if disable file -> textedit do not return. 
This problem has been occured with glXDestroyContext on a radeon graphics 
card on FreeBSD 5.0-RELEASE (possibly this is a bug in the file -> textedit
implementation itself).

=============
--with-nebula              
=============

Use if you want to convert to The Nebula Device 3D engine.
With this feature, white_dune joined forces with "SAND dune"
(Save As Nebula Device) by Aaron Cram (based on Stephen F. Whites dune 0.13). 
Unfortunatly, it looks like the convertion to The Nebula Device 3D engine 
only works with some VRML files exported from the Maya modeller.
For more information see http://www.ori.org/~aaronc/code/nebula/

=======================
--with-textureimagemode
=======================

Dune can use a nonstandard "mode" field in the TextureImage node.

===================
--with-optimization
===================

Optimize for speed.

=====================
--without-optbigfiles
=====================

Like --with-optimization, but without optimization of some big files. This
is only usefull on machines with low memory and systems with compilation
errors in this situation (like the default Sony Playstation 2 Linux 
configuration).

============
--with-gprof
============

Compile with support for the gprof analyser to messure how much time
has been spend in various regions of the code.
After run, a file gmon.out will occure. See the messure with "gprof dune".

===========
--with-gcov
===========

Compile with support for the gprof analyser to messure how much time
has been spend in various line of the code and test if a test procedure
touched or missed some execution paths.

===============
--with-archives
===============

Link via archives. This option is used for machines with very limited RAM 
memory and enough disk space to store the object files in archives.
The resulting archives are are rather useless beside few optimizing compiling
speed on some older hardware. 
White_dune as a OpenGL program is usually not started twice on a machine, 
building shared libraries (which require additional processorpower on
program startup) out of this archives would be a waste of energy
resources.

=============
--with-static
=============

Link with the -static option. 
You may think about using this option on machines where the installation of
some libraries (like lesstif/motif or glut) is not easy (like MacOSX or
Sony Playstation 2 Linux) and you want to distribute a binary.
But in this situtation it is better to create static versions of the needed
libraries and configure the usage of this libraries with the CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS 
and LDFLAGS compiler and linker flags.

================
--without-ranlib
================           

Avoid the usage of the ranlib command.

==========================================================================
BUILD INSTRUCTIONS FOR WIN32 (Micro$oft Visual C++ 6.0):
--------------------------------------------------------

Run one of the following scripts in white_dune_directory\batch (you may
need to run this file from the "cmd" program may need to "cd" into
the white_dune_directory\batch directory first)

jpg_png_zlib.bat (recommended, version which need the expat, jpeg, libpng 
                  zlib, GLU, freetype2 etc. libraries)
nt.bat           (version without the need of a noncommon library)

The usage of jpg_png_zlib.bat is recommended. You get a version, which can 
display ImageTextures, but can only use image formats really supported by 
the VRML97 standard (jpeg and png). If white_dune is linked with libjpeg, 
this software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group.

When not using jpg_png_zlib.bat, you get a version, which can not display 
ImageTextures and can not load XML encoded X3D files, but do not need any 
additional library. 

When you try to install a development version, you are often forced to use 
batch\jpg_png_zlib.bat.

You can find sources, binaries and needed Micro$oft Visual C++ project 
files of the needed libraries at
ftp://ftp.ourproject.org/pub/wdune/expat_jpeg_png_zlib_win64static14.zip
for windows 7/10 64Bit

The later version also includes a updated libGLU library for 
NurbsTrimmedSurface compatibility.
The later version also includes a updated freetype2 library for 
string rendering.

If you want to change the parser.y/lexer.l files, you need to install the
cygwin programs "bash", "flex" and "bison" from http://www.cygwin.com/
and need to customise the batch files white_dune_directory\batch\usebison.bat 
and white_dune_directory\batch\useflex.bat

In case of the build command finds no bash, flex and bison tools, the output
previously generated under Linux/Unix/MacOSX (files lexer.cpp and parser.cpp) 
will be used. 
If you use the Linux/Unix/MacOSX files, you should avoid to use the 
"rebuild all" menupoint, otherwise lexer.cpp and parser.cpp would be removed 
and you would need another copy of this files.

If you want to read and write X3D Files via the java translators from
Qiming Wang, you need to download the files from 
   http://ovrt.nist.gov/v2_x3d.html 
and extract them into the directories ./v2x3d and ./x3dv2

Another (better ?) source for this files is from the X3Dedit distribution 
http://www.web3d.org/x3d/content/README.X3D-Edit.html

There is also a solution based on Windows Scripting Host in the tools 
directory (see tools/xsl_js.bat).

Open the dune.dsw workspace file, and custumise the include/link paths
to needed libaries. 

The defaults are: 

for jpeg_png_zlib version:
   /I include paths for jpg_png_zlib
      white_dune_directory\..\jpeg-8b
      white_dune_directory\..\libpng-1.4.4
      white_dune_directory\..\libpng-1.2.5
  libaries:
      white_dune_directory\..\jpeg-8b/jpeg/Debug/jpeg.lib
      white_dune_directory\..\libpng-1.4.4/libpng/Debug/libpng.lib
      white_dune_directory\..\zlib-1.2.5/zlib/Debug/zlib.lib

Then select "build dune.exe" from the build menu.
You will find the executable in the directory Debug (or X64/Debug on 
64Bit Machines).


==========================================================================
BUILD INSTRUCTIONS FOR WIN32 (Visual Studio Community versions):
--------------------------------------------------------------

It is possible to build white_dune with at least some Visual Studio Express
and Visual Studio Community compilers. This is very similar to the build with 
Micro$oft Visual C++ 6.0, with the following differences:

- instead of opening dune.dsw, open dune.vcxproj

When building excutables for Windows XP and above, it is needed to
run batch/jpg_png_zlib.bat to write src/config.h. You also need to extract
ftp://ftp.ourproject.org/pub/wdune/expat_jpeg_png_zlib_win64static15.zip
to add needed libraries. Then open dune.vcxproj
 

==========================================================================
BUILD INSTRUCTIONS FOR GNU CYGWIN (WIN32) system):
--------------------------------------------------

It is possible to compile and run white_dune with the GNU CYGWIN system
using the free gcc/g++ compilers, but currently (August 2005) you need to use
a WIN32 based X11 system. 
Currently, the OpenGL system shipped with CYGWIN is rather slow compared
with the native WIN32 version.
For build instructions for the GNU CYGWIN system see 
"BUILD INSTRUCTIONS FOR UNIX/Linux".
